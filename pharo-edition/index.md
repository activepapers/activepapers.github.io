## The ActivePapers Pharo edition

The [Pharo](https://pharo.org/) edition of ActivePapers focuses on
exploring the documentation and user interface aspects of
computational science.  It is based on the [Glamorous
Toolkit](http://gtoolkit.com/), an innovative development environment
for Pharo based on the concept of moldable development (see [this blog post](https://osoco.es/thoughts/2019/05/designing-media-for-thought-with-moldable-development/) for an introduction and further references).

The Pharo edition is work in progress. Anything can change at any
time. Even GToolkit is still labelled as alpha software. Don't build
anything important on top of this code.

After that warning, feel free to explore the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/activepapers/activepapers-pharo).
