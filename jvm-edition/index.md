## The ActivePapers JVM edition

The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) edition of ActivePapers comes closest
to the ideals of the ActivePapers project in terms of reproducibility
and secure execution of downloaded code. Its main inconvenience is
that the JVM is not very popular in scientific computing, leading to
an insufficient choice of existing libraries in most application
domains.

The development of the ActivePapers JVM edition is
[hosted on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/khinsen/active_papers).
